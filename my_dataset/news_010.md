A forum tackling the more challenging problems in urban development gathered people in this area on Saturday to raise awareness of greener and more sustainable urban development.

Attendees at the China Urban Development and Finance Forum, sponsored by Shunxin Construction, exchanged views on urban development that is "innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared by all", where government, enterprises and institutes can work together to achieve win-win results.

Wang Yawei, board chairman of Shunxin Construction, said his company will adhere to development that is "innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared by all" and push forward supply-side reform to grow sustainably. Wei Wuqun, general manager[please check to make sure my edit is more accurate] of Shunxin Construction Investment and Fund, said funding is one of the best solutions to urban development and state-owned enterprise reform.

Wang Zhongjie from the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design took Sanya of Hainan province as an example to explain the concept of "urban restoration", which has a goal of restoring the urban environment and the look of the city with its cultural connotations.

China is on an urbanization campaign to tackle overcrowded big cities and underdeveloped second- and third-tier cities and townships after the 19th Congress of the CPC.

The forum included two seminars on the balance between urban development and environmental resources and smart urban finance respectively. Representatives from pilot cities of urban restoration attended the seminars to share their experience and views.
